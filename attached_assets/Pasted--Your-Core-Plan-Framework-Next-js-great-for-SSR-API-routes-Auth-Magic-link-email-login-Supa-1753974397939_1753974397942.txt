✅ Your Core Plan
Framework: Next.js (great for SSR + API routes)

Auth: Magic link email login (Supabase makes this easy)

AI Logic: n8n handles workflows (e.g., sends prompt to OpenAI, saves result)

DB: Supabase (auth + user data) + MongoDB (store user resumes, templates, settings)

Deployment: Vercel with CI/CD (push to GitHub, auto deploy)

Perfect stack for a modern AI SaaS.

🌙✨ Moon & Stars Theme
Your theme can be a unique selling point.
Use a dark, cosmic vibe — gradients, twinkling stars, subtle animations.
Example:

Background: Animated starfield or subtle parallax stars.

Moon Phases: Could represent user progress (e.g., crescent = incomplete profile, full moon = complete resume).

Accent Colors: Midnight blue, silver, soft purple glows.

Use TailwindCSS + Framer Motion for smooth animations.

🚀 Extra Features to Stand Out
Here’s where you shine. Add some or all:

🔮 1. Live Resume Preview
As the user fills in details, show a live PDF/HTML preview side by side.

Include multiple beautiful templates they can switch between instantly.

🤖 2. Smart AI Suggestions
Add “AI improve my section” buttons next to each input.

Example: They write a work experience → AI polishes wording.

Or: “Generate achievements for this role.”

🎯 3. Skill Match / Job Matching
Let users paste a job description.

AI highlights resume gaps and suggests edits to match the job.

Shows a “match score” with moon phases or stars.

🪄 4. Cover Letter Generator
1-click: “Write my cover letter for this job.”

Uses same data as the resume.

📂 5. Export & Sharing
Download as PDF.

One-click shareable link with custom domain.

Option to password-protect online resumes.

🗂️ 6. Version History
Users can save multiple resume versions (for different jobs).

Compare differences visually.

🎨 7. AI-Powered Themes
Let AI adapt the design — dark/light, fonts, colors.

Or choose “Galaxy,” “Nebula,” “Lunar Eclipse” themes for fun.

🎁 8. Easter Egg
Maybe a hidden “Night Mode” that turns the moon into an interactive mini-game 🌕✨

Or a small fortune cookie pop-up with a motivational quote when they save.

🔑 Technical Suggestions
Frontend: Next.js + TailwindCSS + Framer Motion.

Auth: Supabase magic link.

AI: n8n orchestrates calls to OpenAI, saves results.

Database: MongoDB for resume documents, templates.

Storage: Supabase storage or S3 for PDF export.

PDF Generation: Next.js API route → Puppeteer or React-PDF.

Deploy: Vercel + GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

Analytics: Simple user dashboard for views/downloads.

✨ Bonus: Viral Touch
Add a share badge: “Made with ✨ MoonResume ✨”

User can embed a badge on LinkedIn or portfolio.
